            <p>Hey there, my name is Steven Spencer. I'm a Full Stack Web Developer living in Worcester Massachusetts. This is the third official iteration of my portfolio, which I've designed and built completely from scratch using ReactJS and Redux.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>I'm 22 years old, and have been programming for the past 7 years. I started working with Java back in my second year of highschool in 2014, and back in the beginning of 2020 I started moving my focus towards web development, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few frameworks and libraries to go along with regular 'ol JavaScript. A large portion of my fundamental knowledge of web development comes from my studies at Lambda School, which I started in Febrary 2020, where I spent 55 hours weekly learning everything from basic HTML to advanced searching/sorting algorithms for 9 months. Since finishing my studies at the school in October 2020, I've been refining my skills and improving my front end technique through Udemy courses focusing on areas such as Angular, TypeScript, and PHP, as well as working on personal projects to show off how I've grown as a web developer in the past year and a half.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>During my studies at Lambda School, I was hired part-time as a Team Lead to work alongside the instructors of classes that were less deep into the curriculum than myself. This position pushed me to develop even further as a programmer, because it came with the responsibility of helping a group of up to 12 other students understand the material from their lectures, grading their assignments and tests, and pushing them to develop further as programmers as well.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Outside of web development (I'd love to say web dev is my whole life, but unfortunately I'm a human (at least for now) and have side-interests and hobbies) I typically spend my time tinkering with things. I hardly think of myself as a creative person, but when I have an idea in mind I will typically persevere until the project is complete. I spend a lot of time playing guitar, working with cars, and dabbling with both the hardware and software end of technology. Those interests translate to a bunch of hobbies from writing, playing, and improvising music, to having exciting days at car meetups, to getting complete tunnel vision towards completing a simple Python script that automates something that could easily be done manually.</p>
